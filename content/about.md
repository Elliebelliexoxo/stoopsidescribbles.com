# About Me

Hi, I'm Ellie Goetz. Welcome to Stoop Side Scribbles!

## What I Do

I'm a writer and traveler who believes in the power of storytelling. This blog is my space to share experiences, thoughts, and the little moments that make life worth living.

## Why I Write

Writing helps me process the world around me. Whether it's a travel adventure, a personal reflection, or just something that caught my attention, putting thoughts into words helps me understand them better.

## Get in Touch

I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out if you want to connect or just say hello.

Thanks for reading!

-Ellie
