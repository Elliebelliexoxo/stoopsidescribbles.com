# 10 Days in London

London is a city that never fails to amaze me. From the historic architecture to the bustling streets, every corner holds a story waiting to be discovered.

## Day 1: Arrival

Stepping off the plane at Heathrow, the familiar smell of rain and diesel greeted me. London in January is exactly as you'd expect - gray skies, occasional drizzle, and that unmistakable British charm.

## Exploring the Classics

Over the next few days, I revisited some of my favorite spots:
- The British Museum (always worth a visit)
- Covent Garden for street performances
- Camden Market for the eclectic vibe
- A proper afternoon tea at The Ritz

## Hidden Gems

Some of the best moments came from unexpected discoveries:
- A tiny bookshop in Soho with first editions
- A pub in Notting Hill where locals actually drink
- The view from Primrose Hill at sunset

## Final Thoughts

Ten days wasn't nearly enough, but it was enough to remind me why I love this city so much. London has a way of making you feel both at home and completely out of place, which is exactly what makes it so special.

Until next time, London.
