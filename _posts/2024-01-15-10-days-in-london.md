Today marks 10 days in London! In between moving into my flat and attending orientation, I explored the historic districts and sights within zones 1 and 2 of the city. From doing a bus tour to visiting the Crown Jewels, I fawned over all of the major tourist attractions. Here are eight of my takes on what I saw.

### Big Ben is BEAUTIFUL.
For a relatively cloudy city, the clock seems to attract sunshine. It was bright and beautiful and so golden. I had no idea.

### The Tower of London looks so much shorter from the street and so much wider.
I had no idea it was a large property, I had always pictured it being one singular tower. I don't know why I pictured it as a skyscraper.

### Westminster Abbey was amazing
but I felt weird walking all over the graves/monuments for so many renowned people.

### I like that the Tube is so quiet!
It was a refreshing change from the Subway.

### I was surprised how much Princess Diana stuff is sold around the city.
I didn't see any Queen Camilla...

### British Museums being freeeee is amazing
and I loved the British History Museum but the art should be returned to their original countries. It made me sad and I want to learn more about the situation and how to get involved.

### Lots of PRETS!
I was skeptical but it tastes way better than NYC's PRETS. Also a great plan. For 30 pounds a month you can get 5 coffees a day.

### The best Indian food EVER!!
I have had Indian like 5 times.

Anyways, now I am excited to begin really immersing myself in the city. I've started to do small things to help make my life here feel more normal, instead of just a vacation. I ran 3 miles next to the River Thames, explored the Leadenhall Market, and ate a full English Breakfast. Today I am going to explore Oxford Street and window shop. I want to come out of my shell a little bit more and meet some more Londoners!
